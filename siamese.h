/** \page Siamese Streaming Erasure Code Library

    Siamese is a simple, portable library for streaming erasure codes in C++.
    From given data it generates redundancies that can recover lost originals.

    It is a streaming erasure code designed for low or medium rate streams
    under 2000 packets per round-trip and modest loss rates like 20% or less.

    It can also generate selective acknowledgements and retransmitted data to be
    useful as the core engine of a Hybrid ARQ transport protocol.

    Key features:
    + Designed for use on mobile handset, PC, and server hardware.
    + As a streaming erasure code, lost packets can be recovered immediately
      rather than waiting for a larger block to completely arrive.
    + The packet data can be of variable length up to half a gigabyte.
    + The codec makes no assumptions about received data being processed
      in-order by the application, but it can be used to efficiently implement
      both TCP-style in-order or first-in unordered consumption of data.
    + Provides a jitter buffer for incoming sequenced data.
    + This convenient C API is provided, making it easy to wrap for different
      languages, or to integrate as a plugin for an engine.
    + Handles round-trip time estimation and retransmit timeouts.
    + Only the siamese_encode() and siamese_decode() functions are expensive.

    Limitations:
    + The API is not thread-safe so a lock should be held while calling.
    + Recovery failure happens about 0.3% of the time and may require one more
      recovery packet in that case.
    + Decoding gets O(N^2) more expensive as the loss rate increases, which
      means it is suitable for modest loss rates and data sizes[1].

      [1] Note that for larger data, the Wirehair codec may be a better choice
          since it can handle much larger data without getting slower:
          https://github.com/catid/wh256
          For a window of 1000 packets in flight and 10% loss rate, the overall
          latency for data is about the same between codecs.  Wirehair becomes
          preferrable as the window size and loss rate grow.

    Performance features:
    + Novel generator matrix structure with fast matrix-vector multiplication,
      switching at low data rates to parity/Cauchy rows.
    + Vectorized arithmetic tuned for ARM NEON, Intel SSSE3, AVX2.
    + Custom memory allocator to store packet data in flight on both sides,
      speeding _add() functions by 5x; in-place buffer reuse where possible.
    + Minimized copies across API boundary (footers instead of headers, etc).
    + Matrix solver tuned for typical dense lower-triangular matrices.

    Code design principles:
    + Namespacing and simple C API (versioning + error codes) to enable reuse.
    + Assertions wherever possible to catch bugs closer to the root cause.
    + Optional software features enabled via #ifdef switches to bisect issues.
    + Modular design allowing graduated unit tests to verify code components.
    + Graceful handling of memory allocation failures.
    + Whitespace-clean and commented code for readability.

    Note that calling this periodically is currently required for the library to

    Siamese cannot flush old data from memory without feedback from the encoder,
    so the memory usage will grow without bound if FEC recovery data is not
    received from the encoder.  This problem exists because the decoder uses
    the recovery messages to know when to let go of old data.
