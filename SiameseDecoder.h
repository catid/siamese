/**
    Siamese Decoder Data Recovery Process

    (1) Collect data:

    This collects original data packets and recovery packets, until a solution
    may be possible (recovery is possible about 99.9% of the time).

    Recovery data is stored in a matrix with this structure:

                    original data:
        recovery 0: 012345
        recovery 1: 01234567
        recovery 2:     45678
        recovery 3:     456789

    such that the left and right sides of the non-zero matrix elements described
    by the recovery packets are monotonically increasing, which enables several
    algorithms to work quickly on the input data.

    (2) Generate recovery matrix:

    The recovery matrix is a square GF(2^^8) where the width of the matrix is
    the number of losses we are trying to recover.  The recovery matrix elements
    are sampled from a larger matrix that is implicit (not actually constructed),
    where the columns correspond to original data and the rows correspond to
    recovery packets.

    (3) Solve recovery matrix:

    We experimentally perform Gaussian elimination on the matrix to put it in
    upper triangular form.  If this is successful, then recovery can proceed.
    Note that we have done no operations on the original data yet, so this step
    is fairly inexpensive.

    To speed up this step with the density of the matrix in mind, we attempt
    GE without pivoting first and then switch to a pivoting algorithm as zeroes
    are encountered.

    If this fails we attempt to build a larger recovery matrix involving more
    received recovery packets, which may also involve more lost original data.
    If recovery is not possible with the received data, then we wait for more.

    (4) Eliminate received data:

    This step involves most of the received data and takes the most time.
    Its complexity is slightly less than that of the encoder.  As a result,
    and improvement in encoder performance will translate to a faster decoder.

    For each recovery packet involved in solution we need to eliminate original
    data that is outside of the recovery matrix, so that the recovery matrix can
    be applied to recover the lost data.

    We construct the sums of received original data for each row as in the encoder,
    and roll the sums up as the left side is eliminated from later recovery packets.
    The sums are reused on multiple rows to eliminate data faster.

    (5) Recover original data:

    The same operations performed to arrive at the GE solution earlier are now
    performed on the recovery data packets.  We then multiply by the upper
    triangle of the recovery matrix in back substitution order.  Finally the
    diagonal is eliminated by dividing each recovery packet by the diagonal.
    The recovery packets now contain original data.

    The original data are prefixed by a length field so that the original data
    length can be recovered, since we support variable length input data.

    recovery region so far, noting that there may be some recovery packets we
    have not added to the checked region yet.

    The checked region is helpful since recovery can fail or we may not have
